## Lab content
These labs were designed for students with no prior programming experience. Many sections of the code are intentionally written inefficiently, because students had not yet learned more advanced concepts (for loops, libraries, etc). A brief description of skills and topics covered in each lab is included below. Each lab is provided as a Jupyter Notebook both with and without answers, in addition to as `PDF` files (in the folders `PDF_Lab_Keys` and `PDF_Labs`).

### Lab 1
- Python data types
- Conditional logic in Python
- Looping over data in Python
- Introduction to libraries

### Lab 2
- Numpy arrays
- Importing data from a file into a Numpy array
- Examining and plotting data in a Numpy array

### Lab 3
- Matrix algebra by hand (10-minute class exercise, not included)
- Matrix algebra in Python
- Functions

### Lab 4
- Reading in data using the Pandas library
- Review of linear regression
- Plotting in three dimensions

### Lab 5
- Inspecting and cleaning data in Pandas
- Working with figure objects in Matplotlib
- Joining two Pandas dataframes
- Plots with multiple subplots
- Plotting scatterpoints colored by group

### Lab 6
- Review of importing and inspecting data
- Split a dataset into a training and test set
- Train a machine learning classifier using scikit-learn

### Lab 7
- K-means clustering using scikit-learn
- Custom Matplotlib legends
