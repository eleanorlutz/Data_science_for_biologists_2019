    "## K-means clustering with sci-kit learn\n",
    "\n",
    "K-means clustering is an iterative clustering algorithm that is used to cluster unlabeled data. For example, the data you have may be unlabeled because it was collected by someone else who didn't have time to label everything by hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initialization:** First, k-means randomly chooses ${k}$ samples from the data to use as the initial cluster centers (${k}$ is the number of clusters). \n",
    "- **Cluster Assignment:** Next, each data point is assigned to the cluster center that is closest to that data point. \n",
    "- **Move centroid:** At this point each cluster center should have a set of data points associated with that cluster assignment. We will now update the cluster center to be the mean of all of the data points assigned to that cluster. \n",
    "- **Iterate:** The previous step will likely move the cluster centers. If it did, we will repeat the process again and again until the centroids no longer move after the cluster assignment step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an animation showing the steps of K-means clustering for ${k = 4}$\n",
