    "\n",
    "There are several basic data types we can work with in Python. This week we'll look at some of the most common types of data - comments, numbers, strings, variables, and lists. Each of these types of data have specific rules for how Python can understand and manipulate the data. For example, strings and lists can be evaluated using the command `len()` to find the length. However, Python cannot use `len()` to find the number of digits in a number. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Comments\n",
    "Comments are like notes in the margins of your wet lab notebook. Use comments to describe what a piece of code is doing and why, so that other people (or future you!) can more easily understand your code. Although comments are ignored by Python, they are crucial for making sure that your code is legible and useful for research. \n",

There are thousands of useful Python libraries you can use, and you can even write your own libraries to share with other scientists. In this class we'll learn to use several of the default libraries including `numpy` (which contains code to efficiently work with matrices, linear algebra, and random numbers).\n",

    "For this lab, we will use another library called `matplotlib` as an example. Matplotlib is a plotting library - it helps you make figures and plots quickly. Matplotlib is a very large library, so it has some subsections that we can reference. For this lab we want to import a specific subsection of the `matplotlib` library called `pyplot`. To do this we can import the library subsection using the command `import matplotlib.pyplot`. Then we can use code kept within the library subsection by using the keyword `matplotlib.pyplot`. \n",

    "However, `matplotlib.pyplot` is a very long phrase to have to type multiple times. Similar to variables, we can give libraries nicknames as well, by using the phrase `as` right after importing the library.

    "You'll notice in the code block below, where we import the `matplotlib.pyplot` library, there is also another line of code: `% matplotlib inline`. This is a snippet of code called a **magic command**. This particular magic command tells your Jupyter Notebook to show your plots and figures inside of the Jupyter Notebook itself, instead of saving them elsewhere. We will be using this code snippet throughout this class to quickly see what we are plotting within our Jupyter Notebook. "

    "When we typed the command `y = x`, we were intending to make a *copy* of the original variable `x`. But in Python, when we set a variable to `=` another variable, it does not actually make a copy of the original variable. Instead, it creates a new reference (or shortcut) that remembers the association between the two variables. "
